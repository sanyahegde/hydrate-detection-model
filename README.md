Hydrate Detection Model Using Random Forest
This project uses a Random Forest Algorithm to predict hydrate formation in industrial pipelines. By analyzing CSV files provided by the company, the model evaluates key variables such as:

Volume Difference: The difference between the instantaneous and setpoint gas meter volumes.
Valve Percent Open: The openness of the injection valve.
Key Features
Dynamic Feature Engineering:

Creates a Volume_Difference feature from input data.
Dynamically sets thresholds for hydrate detection based on statistical analysis (e.g., 95th percentile).
Random Forest Algorithm:

Utilizes an ensemble of decision trees to predict hydrate formation.
Balances class weights to handle imbalanced datasets.
Performs cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes effectively.
Visualization:

Outputs scatterplots that display Volume Difference against Valve Percent Open, with color-coded predictions (hydrate detected or not).
Visual representations make it easier to interpret predictions.
Data Handling:

Reads and preprocesses real-world CSV data to handle missing values and engineer features.
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets for robust evaluation.
Model Performance:

Provides classification reports detailing precision, recall, F1 scores, and accuracy.
Validates the model on unseen data (e.g., Fearless.csv) to ensure reliability.
How It Works
Load Data: Combines multiple CSV files provided by the company.
Preprocess Data:
Handles missing values.
Engineers features relevant to hydrate formation.
Train Model:
Fits a Random Forest Classifier to predict hydrate presence (Hydrate_Detected).
Evaluate Model:

Validates predictions using test data and cross-validation.
Visualize Predictions:
Scatterplots highlight relationships between key features and predictions.
Results
The model achieves high accuracy in predicting hydrate formation based on the provided dataset.
Visualizations demonstrate clear clusters of data points where hydrates are likely or unlikely.
